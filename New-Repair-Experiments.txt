Scenario #1

First attempt at a Concuerror model.  Don't perform any repair protocol
yet.  Just have a couple of concurrent writers for a single log
position/key during a concurrent layout change.

Hrm, I managed to screw up something in the Git commit history.  I've
a patch that needs to be applied outside of commit e0871e.

No errors expected.  No errors found by Concuerror, hooray.

% git checkout 654356d3d36cb137ea598eef17231f5ab45e0500 ; cp fix-repair-ret-val.e0871e.patch /tmp
% git checkout e0871e71094eeaba1d3e113760fae8ee3f642a4b
% patch -p1 < /tmp/fix-repair-ret-val.e0871e.patch
% make clean ; env CONC_OPTS="--depth_bound 250 -o concuerror_report.commit=e0871e.txt.`date +%s`" make conc_write1_test

Scenario #2

First attempt at a repair protocol, using Machi's scheme.  We know that
there's a race condition which permits a previously written value to be
observed as unwritten.  Let's see if Concuerror can find it.

Yes, Concuerror finds it, hooray.

% git checkout . ; git checkout 42323df72174416a22cf90e382e1bdb64e0734f3
% make clean ; env CONC_OPTS="-b 3 --depth_bound 450 -o concuerror_report.commit=42323d.txt.`date +%s`" make conc_write_repair1_test

Scenario #3

Second attempt at a repair protocol.  This is a new idea, "head of heads"
repair instead of Machi's "tail of tails".  It probably suffers from a
similar problem as #2, but let's try it anyway.

Concuerror finds a problem.  OK, we won't explore this repair protocol
variation any further.

% git checkout 3037f8c10a97bbf837d2bf715f6acb6481492aff
% make clean ; env CONC_OPTS="-b 3 --depth_bound 450 -o concuerror_report.commit=3037f8.txt.`date +%s`" make conc_write_repair2_test

Scenario #4

We're pretty sure that this new repair protocol is going to work.  It's
divided into two different implementations: starting chain length=1
(difficult/unknown result) and starting chain length>1 (predicted to be
error-free).  There are two different Makefile targets for these two
cases.

Hooray, no problems found in either case!  It works, or I've a bug!  ^_^

% git checkout 147a3b3f325070dc9add0e3dfba00d4c7711ecb4
% make clean ; env CONC_OPTS="-c simple -b 5 --depth_bound 450 -o concuerror_report.commit=14713b.txt.`date +%s`" make conc_write_repair3_1to2_test ; echo done with one ; make clean ; env CONC_OPTS="-c simple -b 5 --depth_bound 450 -o concuerror_report.commit=14713b.txt.`date +%s`" make conc_write_repair3_2to3_test ; echo done with two git checkout master ; echo Reset back to "'master'" branch for safety/sanity
